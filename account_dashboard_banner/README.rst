The development of this module started with a simple analysis:
accountants tend to forget to update the lock dates. Part of the problem
lies in the fact that the lock dates can be seen in the wizard to update
the lock dates, but accountants have no incentive to start this wizard
regularly to check the lock dates. The idea was to display the lock
dates in a banner at the top of the accounting dashboard, so that
accountants have the value of the lock dates in front of their eyes.

With such a banner in the accounting dashboard to display the lock
dates, there was a great temptation to display other interesting
information in that banner, such as some key figures of the accounting:
liquidity, turnover, customer overdue, etc. It gave birth to the idea to
have a configurable banner in the accounting dashboard!

Configuration
=============

Go to the menu **Invoicing > Configuration > Dashboard > Dashboard
Banner Cells**: in this menu, you can add or remove cells from the
banner, change the cell type, modify the order via drag-and-drop,
customize the labels if necessary.

|Cell configuration menu|

Many cell types are available:

- **Income** with 4 options: *Fiscal Year-to-date Income*, *Year-to-date
  Income*, *Quarter-to-date Income* and *Month-to-date Income*. It
  displays the period balance of the accounts with type *Income* and
  *Other Income*.
- **Liquidity**: it display the ending balance of the accounts linked to
  a bank or cash or credit journal.
- **Customer Debt**: it displays the ending balance of the default
  *Account Receivable* and, if the point of sale is installed, the
  intermediary account used for unidentified customers.
- **Customer Overdue**: same as the *Customer Debt*, but limited to
  journal items with a due date in the past.
- **Supplier Debt**: it displays the ending balance of the default
  *Account Payable*.
- **Lock dates**: all the lock dates are available: *Tax Return Lock
  Date*, *Sales Lock Date*, *Purchase Lock Date*, *Global Lock Date* and
  *Hard Lock Date*.

The module is designed to allow the modification of the computation of
the different cell types by inheriting the method
*\_prepare_cell_data\_<cell_type>()* or *\_prepare_cell_data()*. It is
also easy for a developper to add more cell types.

It is possible to display a cell as a warning cell (yellow background
color instead of light grey): click on the *Warning* option and
customize the conditions to trigger the warning.
