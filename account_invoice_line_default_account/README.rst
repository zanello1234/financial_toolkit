When entering sales or purchase invoices directly, the user has to select an
account which will be used as a counterpart in the generated move lines. Each
supplier will mostly be linked to one account. For instance when ordering paper
from a supplier that deals in paper, the counterpart account will mostly be
something like 'office expenses'. The same principle has been applied for
customers. This module will add a default counterpart expense and income
account to a partner, comparable to the similiar field in product. When an
invoice is entered, withouth a product, the field from partner will be used as
default. Also when an account is entered on an invoice line (not automatically
selected for a product), the account will be automatically linked to the
partner as default expense or income account, unless explicitly disabled in the
partner record.

Configuration
=============

To configure the default accounts for a partner:

1. Go to Contacts
2. Open a partner record
3. In the "Accounting" tab, you will find:
   - Default Income Account: Used for sales invoices
   - Default Expense Account: Used for purchase invoices
   - Checkboxes to enable/disable auto-updating these accounts from invoice lines

Usage
=====

Creating Invoices
-----------------

When creating invoices without products:

1. Create a new invoice
2. Add a line without selecting a product
3. The account will be automatically filled from the partner's default account
4. If you change the account, it will update the partner's default (if auto-update is enabled)

Auto-update Feature
-------------------

When the auto-update feature is enabled for a partner:

1. Any manual account change on invoice lines (without products) will update the partner's default account
2. This helps maintain consistent accounting for each partner
3. The feature can be disabled per partner if needed
