# üîß Error Fix & Information Update Summary

## ‚úÖ Critical Error Resolved

### Problem Fixed
**Error**: `ValueError: External ID not found in the system: card_credit_management.action_card_accreditation_fee_analysis`

**Root Cause**: The card accreditation view was referencing a non-existent action for the fee invoice button.

### Solution Applied
1. **Created Missing Action**: Added `action_card_fee_invoice_wizard` in `fee_invoice_wizard_view.xml`
2. **Updated Button Reference**: Changed the problematic button to use the correct wizard action:
   ```xml
   <!-- OLD (causing error) -->
   <button name="%(action_card_accreditation_fee_analysis)d" type="action" ...>
   
   <!-- NEW (working) -->
   <button name="%(card_credit_management.action_card_fee_invoice_wizard)d" type="action" ...>
   ```
